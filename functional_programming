## /*Assume you want to build two functions for discounting products on a website.
## Function number 1 is for student discount which discounts the current price to 10%.
## Function number 2 is for additional discount for regular buyers which discounts an additional 5% on the current student discounted price.
## Depending on the situation, we want to be able to apply both the discounts on the products.

## Design the above two mentioned functions and apply them both simultaneously on the price.

def student_discount(price):
    return price - (price * (.1))

def additional_discount(func):
    return price - (price * (.05))

price = 100

result = additional_discount(student_discount(price))

print(result)

# Calculate the value of mathematical expression x*(x+5)^2 where x= 5 using lambda expression.
result = (lambda x: x*(x+5)**2)(5)
print(result)

# Consider a list in Python which includes prices of all the items in a store. Build a function to discount the price of all the products by 10%.
# Use map to apply the function to all the elements of the list so that all the product prices are discounted.

def discount(price):
    price = price - (price * .1)
    return price

prices = [25, 25, 80, 60, 40]
new_prices = list(map(discount, prices))
print(new_prices)
